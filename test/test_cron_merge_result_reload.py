"""A run record refused by a busy result merge must survive a store reload.

``_run_job_isolated`` hands a finished run to ``_merge_job_result``. When the
store lock stays contended the merge raises ``CronStoreBusy`` before it writes
anything, so the run's record exists only in memory. When another writer then
changes ``crons.json``, the next ``_sync`` replaces the job list with the disk
copies, which never received the run. The record must be re-applied to that
reload and persisted by the next save under the lock (the timer tick, or
``stop``), or an ``every`` job runs again early and a fired one-shot runs again.

Contention is simulated by making the store lock raise the exception the real
spin raises. The other writer is a second ``CronService`` on the same directory,
run in a worker thread like a separate process. The real ``_on_timer``,
``_run_job_isolated``, ``_merge_job_result``, ``_sync`` and ``_load`` run
unmodified.
